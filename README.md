##Goal
I am interested in physical hardware for robotics education. In many curricula, students have little to no hands-on experience with physical robotic hardware. Most assignments are implemented on simulation software with real world execution being mostly absent. I propose an inexpensive, simple solution to this problem. Edbot is a four degree-of-freedom serial robot.

The goal is to design a robot which removes the machine design and controller programming difficulties, commonly associated with robotics projects. By removing these extraneous difficulties, students can immediately use the robot as a tool to apply their learned knowledge in the areas of kinematics, dynamics, and control. The robot will also be inexpensive and simple to construct. By relying on an Arduino microcontroller, servo motors, and laser-cut structural elements, the entire robot can be assembled in less than thirty minutes at an approximate cost of $120.

##Parts 
This project is broken into four parts:

- C code running on the Arduino
- Matlab code running on a PC/laptop to communicate with the Arduino
- Solidworks drawings to define the structure and interaction of the physical components
- PDF files for laser cutting the physical components

##To Use
